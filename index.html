							<h2>Who is Luke Scales?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>I am</strong> a diligent, determined developer with a keen eye for detail. I have always had an observant nature and this shines through in my work, as noted <a id="here-link" class="scrolly here-link" href="#mark-recommendation">here</a> by Mark Cummins, CEO of Pointy. I have an innovation mindset: always, subconciously and consciously, searching for ways to improve upon existing processes. I enjoy simplifying bulky operations, automating tasks, and improving the user experience of internal or external systems.</p>
							<p>Due to my artistic abilities I have always been interested in User Interface (UI) design. My interest in UI design naturally progressed into an advocation for good User Experience (UX) design, leading me to study UX design principles and to apply them to my projects. In recent years I have become fascinated with the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) however, and their potential to disrupt every industry. Hence, I applied the TensorFlow ML library to the final year project of my undergraduate studies, while also undertaking an MSc in Computing which majors in AI.</p>

											<p>The aim of this degree is to develop its students into engineers that are capable of working in any role within the robotics industry. However, due to the broad nature of the course, graduates can be found in varying roles across all industries. Personally, I began to <strong>specialise in software</strong> in the latter half of my studies. Taking time out from my degree gave me an opportunity to improve upon my software skills before graduation, which allowed me to achieve more technology-focused goals when I returned to DCU in 2016.</p>

													<h5 class="achievements-head">Urban Art Society</h5>
													<div class="hidden achievements-details">
														<p><strong>In 2012</strong> I founded the DCU Urban Art Society: a society which focuses on street art and street culture while promoting and supporting all forms of urban art. I lead this society for 3 years and it was hailed as one of the fastest growing societies on campus, growing from 30 members in its first year to over 300 the following year (the average society in DCU has under 100 members). During my tenure we supported and collaborated with societies on campus with nobler goals, such as DCU's Mental Health Society, Animal Welfare Society, and DCU's "RAG" (Raising & Giving) Society.</p>

														<div class="caption">Photo and paintings by PichiAvo.</div>
														<p>My work with this society helped me to gain experience in many areas:</p>
														<ul>
															<li><strong>Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator</strong> - through designing the society's logo and making posters.</li>
															<li><strong>Event Management & Planning</strong> - from organising weekly tutorials and small socials to planning and executing events for over 600 students on campus and trips abroad for 20-30 students.</li>
															<li><strong>Email Marketing</strong> - from writing and designing weekly emails, to performing A/B testing and implementing services such as Google Analytics and Mailchimp, this society gave me some great experience with email marketing.</li>
															<li><strong>Leadership</strong> - running this society gave me an opportunity to practice and refine my leadership skills and methodologies.</li>

													<div class="hidden achievements-details">
														<p><strong>A side hustle</strong> I had been running for about a year previously, in 2014 I decided I would progress my t-shirt making gig by branding it. I began designing logos and researching branding, while exploring how to order hoodies and other garments from manufacturers overseas.</p>

														<p>From setting up stalls at events and music festivals in Ireland, to designing and ordering hoodies for societies at DCU, this became a great way to bolster my income throughout my studies. It was also a great learning opportunity, where I gained experience in:</p>
														<ul>
															<li><strong>Branding & Logo Design</strong></li>
															<li><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong></li>
															<li><strong>Supply Chain Management</strong></li>
															<li><strong>Shipping & Procurement</strong></li>

											<p>When I was halfway through my third year, in 2014, I had to take two years out of my degree to work full time and help support my family. Before I left I began learning Android by undertaking a simple Android project with Dr. Bryan MacDonald, Associate Professor of DCU. During my time out from my degree I continued to improve upon my programming ability and I was awarded a scholarship for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. This further propelled my capabilities as an <strong>Android developer</strong>.</p>

											<p>Upon returning to DCU in 2016, I had a newfound sense of determination and maturity. I came first in my class in some subjects (such as the Continuous Assessment elements of Image Processing & Analysis) and finished in the top 3 for most others. I proposed my own topic for my "Final Year Project" (FYP), of which Dr. Bryan MacDonald thankfully accepted to be my Project Supervisor. This project presented a novel take on the typical calorie-counting/diet-management application, applying <strong>Machine Learning-based image classification</strong> and a <strong>Bluetooth Low Energy</strong> kitchen scale to enhance the <strong>User Experience</strong> of these apps.

										<blockquote>Luke joined Pointy at one of the highest growth phases of our journey. He was thrown in at the deep end in a company and a job that was changing quickly. Not an easy place to start! Luke proved very capable and adaptable. At the start, our systems were relatively immature, and the tools and processes were far from ideal. Working through this was challenging and frustrating at times, but Luke persevered and helped us develop to the point that we have mature systems in a productive and stable state. He has lots of initiative, always looking to take on projects and spotting improvements or solving issues that had been missed by others. I look forward to seeing what Luke builds over the course of his career!</blockquote>

										<p>To move to Canada. There was also a lack of learning opportunites as I was the only Junior Developer at Pointy. The dev team at Pointy are all at a very senior level and, due to the intense nature of a startup in the high-growth phase, most software projects went to the more experienced developers.</p>

										<p><strong>Reasons for Leaving:</strong></p>
										<p>Lack of funding and to focus on my studies before joining ESB for my undergraduate placement. Carpooling as a service resides in a legal grey area in Ireland. The Taxi Regulation Act 2013 was enacted to prevent unlicensed drivers from being allowed to drive passengers for monetary gain, effectively halting Uber's entry into the Irish market. Due to this it was difficult to find funding and, due to this being our first foray into tech entrepreneurship, we were grossly inexperienced. A failure but a great learning experience.</p>
