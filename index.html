                <strong>I am</strong> a diligent, determined developer with a keen eye for detail. I have always had an
                observant nature and this shines through in my work, as noted
                <a id="here-link" class="scrolly here-link" href="#mark-recommendation">here</a>
                by Mark Cummins, CEO of Pointy (<a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-is-buying-pointy-a-startup-that-helps-brick-and-mortar-retailers-list-products-online/">
                    acquired by Google in 2020</a>).
                I have an innovation mindset: always, subconciously and consciously, searching for ways to improve
                upon existing processes. I enjoy simplifying bulky operations, automating tasks, and improving the user
                experience of internal or external systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I have progressed in my career I have enjoyed the opportunity to mentor others and to pass on the
                same knowledge that other great minds have shared with me along my journey.
                I have enjoyed substantial growth in my career, and it now gives me great joy to enable other's growth
                too. This is evident in the recommendations from my time at Nory which can be found

                            in any role within the robotics industry. However, due to the broad nature of the course,
                            graduates can be found in varying roles across all industries. Personally, I began to
                            <strong>specialise in software</strong> in the latter half of my studies. Taking time out
                            from my degree gave me an opportunity to improve upon my software skills before graduation,
                            which allowed me to achieve more technology-focused goals when I returned to DCU in 2016.

                                    <p><strong>In 2012</strong> I founded the DCU Urban Art Society: a society which
                                        focuses on street art and street culture while promoting and supporting all
                                        forms of urban art. I lead this society for 3 years and it was hailed as one of
                                        the fastest growing societies on campus, growing from 30 members in its first
                                        year to over 300 the following year (the average society in DCU has under 100
                                        members). During my tenure we supported and collaborated with societies on
                                        campus with nobler goals, such as DCU's Mental Health Society, Animal Welfare

                                            to performing A/B testing and implementing services such as Google Analytics
                                            and Mailchimp, this society gave me some great experience with email

                                        <li><strong>Leadership</strong> - running this society gave me an opportunity to
                                            practice and refine my leadership skills and methodologies.

                                        DCU. Our winning team, "Hitch", proposed developing an app for organising
                                        carpooling on campus. From winning this hackathon we were awarded an

                                    <p>The focus of SpaceHack was to develop solutions to the issues faced by refugees.
                                        These could be issues that refugees face at any stage of their journey, from
                                        leaving their home country to arriving and integrating with their new country. I
                                        delivered the winning pitch for "BureauCrazy", an app which removes some of the
                                        bureaucracy that refugees deal with in Germany. In particular, the aplication
                                        helps incoming refugees to fill out the many forms that the German authorities
                                        request from them, which were all (at least at the time of the event) only
                                        provided in the German language.</p>

                        <p>When I was halfway through my third year, in 2014, I had to take two years out of my degree
                            to work full time and help support my family. Before I left I began learning Android by
                            undertaking a simple Android project with Dr. Bryan MacDonald, Associate Professor of DCU.
                            During my time out from my degree I continued to improve upon my programming ability and I
                            was awarded a scholarship for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. This further
                            propelled my capabilities as an <strong>Android developer</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Upon returning to DCU in 2016, I had a newfound sense of determination and maturity. I came
                            first in my class in some subjects (such as the Continuous Assessment elements of Image
                            Processing & Analysis) and finished in the top 3 for most others. I proposed my own topic
                            for my "Final Year Project" (FYP), of which Dr. Bryan MacDonald thankfully accepted to be my
                            Project Supervisor. This project presented a novel take on the typical
                            calorie-counting/diet-management application, applying <strong>Machine Learning-based image
                                classification</strong> and a <strong>Bluetooth Low Energy</strong> kitchen scale to
                            enhance the <strong>User Experience</strong> of these apps. You can read the report I wrote

                    <blockquote>
                        Luke was one of Nory's first engineers - when I met him, he had already helped build the
                        foundations for two product modules and was working on our third.
                        Luke's passion for quality, attention to detail and his desire to constantly improve things
                        really stood out. <b>Luke always had time for other engineers, to help them learn and grow and
                        arrive at a better solution together.</b> He's hungry for impact, ready to go the extra mile,
                        and a strong addition to any engineering team.

                        <p>
                            I've had the distinct pleasure of working closely with Luke over the past three years at Nory,
                            and his contributions have been nothing short of exceptional. From the moment he joined as our
                            second engineer, it was clear that Luke was a unique talent. His prowess in product building,
                            machine learning, and software architecture has been pivotal in scaling our product from its
                            infancy to the robust platform it is today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        What sets Luke apart, even more than his technical acumen, is his unwavering commitment to
                        quality and the trustworthiness he brings to the table. In the often tumultuous world of
                        start-ups, having someone like Luke on your side - who consistently delivers, who you can trust
                        implicitly, and who never sacrifices quality for expediency - is invaluable.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        For anyone considering Luke for future endeavors, know that you're not just getting an
                        engineer; you're getting a forward-thinking architect, a reliable partner, and a genuine asset
                        to any team. I wholeheartedly recommend him and am confident that he'll exceed expectations
                        in any endeavor.

                    <blockquote>Luke joined Pointy at one of the highest growth phases of our journey. He was thrown in
                        at the deep end in a company and a job that was changing quickly. Not an easy place to start!
                        Luke proved very capable and adaptable. At the start, our systems were relatively immature, and
                        the tools and processes were far from ideal. Working through this was challenging and
                        frustrating at times, but Luke persevered and helped us develop to the point that we have mature
                        systems in a productive and stable state. He has lots of initiative, always looking to take on
                        projects and spotting improvements or solving issues that had been missed by others. I look
                        forward to seeing what Luke builds over the course of his career!

                        Carpooling as a service resides in a legal grey area in Ireland. The Taxi Regulation Act 2013
                        was enacted to prevent unlicensed drivers from being allowed to drive passengers for monetary
                        gain, effectively halting Uber's entry into the Irish market. Due to this it was difficult to
                        find funding and, due to this being our first foray into tech entrepreneurship, we were grossly
                        inexperienced. A failure but a great learning experience.</p>

                        applying for a contract role. I was initially told to only spend a handful of hours on it and
                        specifically told not to use a database, but I returned to this project at a later date to
                        convert the repo into an example of how I might approach a fullstack project using Python &
                        FastAPI on the backend with a React, Redux, TypeScript frontend. The project is containerised
                        with Docker and uses a Postgres DB instance.</p>

                        robust, meticulous experiments, I was awarded a result of 85.7%: the highest result in my class
                        and 2nd overall out of the 175 students taking the module! This module was shared with 10 other

                        course of about 1.5 weeks I gradually built this digit classifier from the couch while watching
                        TV in the evenings. The model is not complex and no regularization or dropout was employed, just
                        a rough-and-ready example of using TensorFlow JS for in-browser ML applications.</p>
